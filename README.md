# MallocC
## Create an application to allocate enough memory to store 10 integer values (NOT AN ARRAY). 
### Prompt the user for a sequence of 10 numbers and store them in the memory block you allocated. 
### Create a function that will sort the values from largest-to-smallest value (do not use any built-in sort). 
### Display each value in the ordered memory.
### **Note: Use pointers throughout.**
